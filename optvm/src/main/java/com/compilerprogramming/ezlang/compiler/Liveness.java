/**
 * Compute LiveOut for each Basic Block
 *
 * Original Implementation was based on description in 'Engineering a Compiler' 2nd ed.
 * pages 446-447.
 *
 * It turned out that this dataflow implementation cannot correctly handle
 * phis. Therefore, we have to look at alternative approaches when input is SSA form.
 * Surprisingly even with the flawed approach, the lost copy and swap problems
 * appeared to work correctly.
 *
 * Phis need special considerations:
 *
 * Phi inputs are live out at the predecessor blocks, but not live in for phi block.
 * Phi def is live in at phi block but not in live out at predecessor blocks.
 *
 * The new approach is based on formula described in
 * Computing Liveness Sets for SSA-Form Programs
 * Florian Brandner, Benoit Boissinot, Alain Darte, Beno√Æt Dupont de Dinechin, Fabrice Rastello
 *
 * The implementation is the unoptimized simple one.
 * However, we have a modification to ensure that if we see a block
 * which loops to itself and has Phi cycles, then the Phi is only added to
 * PhiDefs.
