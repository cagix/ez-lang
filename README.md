# EeZee Programming Language

This project is part of the https://compilerprogramming.github.io/ project.

The EeZee programming language is designed to allow us to learn various compiler techniques.

## The EeZee Language

The EeZee programming language is a tiny statically typed language with syntax inspired by Swift.
The language has the following features:

* Integer, Struct and 1-Dimensional Array types
* If and While statements
* Functions

The EeZee language specification is [available](https://compilerprogramming.github.io/ez-lang.html).
The language is intentionally very simple and is meant to have just enough functionality to experiment with compiler implementation techniques.

## Modules

The project is under development and subject to change. At this point in time, we have following initial implementations:

* [lexer](./lexer/README.md) - a simple tokenizer.
* [parser](./parser/README.md) - a recursive descent parser and AST.
* [types](/types/README.md) - the type definitions.
* [semantic](./semantic/README.md) - semantic analyzer.
* [stackvm](./stackvm/README.md) - a compiler that generates IR for a stack based virtual machine.
* [registervm](./registervm/README.md) - a compiler that generates a so called three-address IR and an interpreter that can execute the IR.
* [optvm](./optvm/README.md) - WIP optimizing compiler with SSA transformation, constant propagation, graph coloring register allocation 
  targeting an abstract machine. Includes Interpreter to run the abstract machine.
* [seaofnodes](./seaofnodes/README.md) - WIP compiler that generates Sea of Nodes IR, using SoN backend from [Simple](https://github.com/SeaOfNodes/Simple).
  Will generate native code.

## How can you contribute?

The project is educational, with a focus on exploring various compiler algorithms and data structures.
Clarity and simplicity is preferred over a coding style that attempts to do micro optimizations.

Contributions that improve the quality of the implementation, add test cases / documentation or fix bugs, are very welcome. 
I am not keen on language extensions at this stage, but eventually we will be extending the language to explore more 
advanced features.

I am also interested in porting this project to C++, Go, Rust, Swift, D, C, etc. If you are interested in working on such a 
port please contact me via [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/CompilerProgramming/discussions).

## Community Discussions

There is a [community discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/CompilerProgramming/discussions).

## What's next

The project has only just got started, there is lots to do!. See the plan in the [website](https://compilerprogramming.github.io/).
More documentation to follow, but for now please refer to the source code and the site above.
